    <summary>Prime Number Law</summary>

- Every positive integer can be decomposed into a product of primes
- In order for a number `x` to divide a number `y`, `(y/x)` or `y%x = 0`,
<br />all primes in `x`'s prime factorization must be in `y`'s prime factorization

- Highly efficient way to generate a list of primes
- It works by recognizing that all non-prime numbers are divisible by a prime number
